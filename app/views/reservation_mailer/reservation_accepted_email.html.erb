					<h4>With SpaceLender, you pay the price you see listed.</h4>
					<p>
						SpaceLender does not like to burden you, the renter, with extra service fees and charges. The price you saw listed is - and will always be - the price you pay for a listing on SpaceLender. Saw a listing to rent Jan's backyard for a birthday party at a rate of $8 per hour? Then you only pay exactly $8 per hour. We never tack on fees "after the fact". Rest easy!
